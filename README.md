This repository is a **hands-on, real-world MongoDB playground** for Node.js developers. Each example is carefully designed with **dense, production-level code** to teach practical mastery.

## 🛠️ Features

- **CRUD Operations**  
  Real-world insert, update, delete, and read operations using Node.js Native Driver. Includes bulk operations, complex filters, and projection.

- **Aggregation Pipeline Mastery**  
  Multi-stage pipelines with `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$lookup`, `$unwind`, `$addFields`, `$set`, `$unset`, `$bucket`, `$facet`, `$merge`, `$out`, `$sample`. Optimized for real-life scenarios.

- **Indexes & Geospatial Queries**  
  Single, compound, unique, text, and 2dsphere indexes. Includes performance optimization tips and location-based query examples.

- **Transactions**  
  Multi-document ACID transactions with full error handling, rollback strategies, and production-ready patterns.

- **Schema Design Patterns**  
  Embedded vs referenced documents, one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, and `$lookup` joins for relational data structures.

- **Atlas Full-Text Search**  
  Full-Text, Fuzzy, and Autocomplete search examples using `$search`. Includes index creation and query optimization strategies.

- **Advanced Utilities**  
  Pagination, random sampling (`$sample`), and `$merge`/`$out` pipelines for large-scale data operations.

## 🎯 Why This Repo

- Real-world inspired scenarios, **not just toy examples**
